# Privacy Policy of Blockify  
**Last updated:** January 19, 2026  

This Privacy Policy explains how **Blockify**, developed by **Agustín Louro Paz**, collects, uses, protects, and manages user information. By using Blockify, you agree to the practices described herein.

## 1. Data Controller

The data controller is:  
**Agustín Louro Paz**  
Based in Buenos Aires, Argentina  
Contact email: **realtimebsas@gmail.com**

## 2. Information We Collect and How We Use It

Blockify is designed to operate **entirely locally on your device**. We do not send, store, or process your data on external servers. Information is used solely to provide the app’s core functionality:

- **Call Log Access** (`READ_CALL_LOG` / `WRITE_CALL_LOG`):  
  To identify incoming numbers in real time and manage blocked/allowed call history.

- **Contacts** (`READ_CONTACTS`):  
  To create and manage your local “Allowlist” of trusted contacts.

- **Phone State & Call Management** (`READ_PHONE_STATE`, `ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS`):  
  To detect, silence, or automatically reject unwanted calls.

> **Important**: All data processing occurs **exclusively on your device**. We **do not share, sell, or transfer** your information to third parties, except as described in the third-party services section.

## 3. Backups

Backups created by the app are stored **locally on your device** (e.g., in Blockify’s files folder). They are **not synced to the cloud or any external servers**. You are responsible for managing and securing these backups.

## 4. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services for limited purposes:

- **Firebase Crashlytics**:  
  Collects **anonymous technical data** (e.g., device type, OS version, crash reports) to help us diagnose and fix errors.

- **Firebase Analytics**:  
  Gathers aggregated, anonymized usage data (e.g., screen views, interaction events). It **does not collect personally identifiable information**, though it may log anonymized device identifiers (like Android’s AAID), as per Google’s policy.

> Learn more in [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  
> In future updates, we plan to allow users to opt out of these services via app settings.

## 5. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

Data processing is based on your **explicit consent**, granted when you accept the requested permissions during installation or use. You may withdraw this consent at any time by uninstalling the app.

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Access your personal data.
- Request correction or deletion of your data.
- Object to the processing of your data.
- Request data portability (where applicable).
- Withdraw your consent at any time.

Since all data is stored **locally on your device**, the most effective way to exercise these rights is to:
- Manually delete data via the app settings, or
- **Uninstall the app**, which permanently removes all associated data.

For formal requests or questions about your rights, please contact us at: **realtimebsas@gmail.com**. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe (typically within 30 days).

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Blockify is **not intended for children under 13**, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have collected such data without parental consent, we will promptly delete it. Please contact us if you believe this has occurred.

## 8. Data Retention

Your data remains on your device **as long as the app is installed**. Uninstalling Blockify automatically deletes all local data (including allowlists and call logs), unless you’ve created manual backups.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The current version will always be available in the app or on this page. We encourage you to review it occasionally. Changes take effect immediately upon publication.

## 10. Contact

If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:
